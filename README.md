# Day-Calendar
Displays the current date and time, along with a to-do list that the user can add to, mark out, and delete tasks from.

Utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Developed in Visual Studio Code

Hovering over the tasks on the to-do list performs an animation using CSS by changing the color of the hovered task, if unmarked, along with changing
the lower-left border size.

Clicking on the current task, when unmarked, changes the default color to purple and crosses out the text on the task. When clicking on a marked task,
the task returns to its original color and removes the strikethrough of the text.

Adding new tasks can be done by typing out whatever the user wants in the input text bar, and the 'Add Task' button also animates when hovering over it.

The tasks are colored in an alternating pattern to help with visual clarity when looking at the to-do list.
